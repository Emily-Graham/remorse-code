Requirements to be implemented: 
- interface that allows users to input either english or morse code
- tests for any functions that don't interact with the dom
- javaScript functions that translate user input to corrosponding morse code/English
- user feedback for when something goes wrong

Personal stretch goals:
- to create a function that translates visial representation of morse code into audio
- successfully implement MVP with React!
- mobile and large screen responsiveness 
- start implementing good accessability practices
